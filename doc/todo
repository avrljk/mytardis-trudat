. integrate code into Dean's latest Docker container setup
    . scripts to setup mytardis and the app from inside their containers:
        . use "docker-compose exec <container> /bin/bash" to run
	    . ../jk-config-trudat/setup-app.bash
	    . ../jk-config-trudat/setup-celery.bash

. check that both the NIF_certified and DICOM statistics schemas from
  fixtures/mytardisdatacert.json are being created:
    . they are created on-demand when the app is first loaded (apps.py)
    . NIF generic and DICOM stats schema variants:
	. .../open-format/1.0
	. .../open-format/dicom-stats/1.0
    . check they are both created for both DataSet AND DataFile objects
        . .../dataset/...
	. .../datafile/...

. rename mytardisdatacert to trudat? (dir, files, content)
    . use "git status": files renamed for mytardisbf -> mydardisdatacert

. remove
    . previewimage.py

. remove tests; convert BioFormats tests by rewriting
    . tests/

. tasks.py
    . process_meta() needs to check DataSet for each Datafile
        . DataSet retains/gains NIF_certified metadata iff all .PvDatasets it
	  contains are already NIF_certified (numDicomFiles > 0)
            .including the newly added DataFile
        . ensure DataSet locked prior to query/update

. check call_command(loaddata) in apps.py.  Maybe use a safer migration:

. check MIT licence with Andrew
. remove any redundant lines from setup.cfg (tag_svn_revision?)
. rewrite README.md
